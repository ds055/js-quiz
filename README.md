## Installation
N/A

## Usage
* Users will arrive at the website--perhaps discovered via a search engine.
* Users may select to play the game via the "Play" button or view the high scores page with the "High Scores" button.
* After clicking "Play," users will be presented with a series of 10 questions based on popular fantasy titles. 
* Answers will be displayed below the questions. 
* Users can gain 10 seconds by clicking on the correct answer, but an incorrect answer will deduct 5 seconds.
* A game over occurs if users either run out of time or if all questions are answered. 
* Upon a game over, users will see their score (timer) and be able to input their initials. 
* By clicking submit, a local copy of their scores is saved to their machine, and they are redirected to the high scores page. 
* Otherwise, users may forego submitting a score and simply play again by clicking the "Play" button once more.
